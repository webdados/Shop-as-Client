Allows WooCommerce store Administrators and Shop Managers to use the frontend and assign a new phone or email order to a registered or new customer.

== Description ==

Allows a WooCommerce store Administrator or Shop Manager to use the frontend and assign a new order to a registered or new customer, taking advantage of all the frontend functionalities that might not exist on the backend, which can be very useful for phone or email orders.

The order will automatically be assigned to a registered customer if the billing email matches. If no registered user is found, the shop manager can decide to either create a new user or leave the order as if it was inserted by a guest.

Two new fields are added to the billing checkout section, for logged in administrators and shop managers.

== Features ==

* Enter email and phone orders directly on the frontend;
* Create orders for existing users if the email address exists on the customer database;
* Choose either to create a new user or leave the order as if it was inserted by a guest if the email address does not exist on the customer database;
* Compatibility for the WooCommerce block-based Checkout

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to set “Shop as client” to “No” by default? =

Add [this](https://gist.github.com/webdados/fec5983b1be08dc09f290ce707a1bb44) to your (child) theme functions.php file, or use the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/shop-as-client-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=shopasclient_woocommerce_plugin).

= How to set “Create user” to “Yes” by default? =

Add [this](https://gist.github.com/webdados/6e0f3cedb315bfdb9ac258bc6e630101) to your (child) theme functions.php file, or use the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/shop-as-client-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=shopasclient_woocommerce_plugin).

= Which user roles have access to the “Shop as client” functionality? =

Administrators and Shop managers can use “Shop as client” on the checkout.
Add [this](https://gist.github.com/webdados/0f1a8e5ca2cd98276a9ae73918e9b842) to your (child) theme functions.php file if you want to allow other user roles to use this functionality.

= I’m giving discounts user or user role-based. Will this work? =

No. Yes. It’s complicated...

The logged in user is the Administrator or Shop Manager. It’s not possible to integrate with the vast amount of user or user role-based discount plugins when the logged in user is not the customer himself, so any customer roled-based discounts will not be applied.

However, our PRO add-on integrates with the [User Switching](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-switching/) plugin and sets the Administrator or Shop Manager that switched to the customer account as the order handler upon checkout, thus allowing to benefit from the fact the customer is logged in and still use our plugin functionalities, like the payment request gateway and seller tracking.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage? =

Yes, from version 2.1 onwards.

= Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce block-based Cart and Checkout? =

Yes, on the Free version from version 3.5 onwards and on the [PRO add-on](https://nakedcatplugins.com/product/shop-as-client-for-woocommerce-pro-add-on/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=shopasclient_woocommerce_plugin) from version 3.6 onwards.

Known limitations:

* Only core WooCommerce fields are saved to the customer user, and not custom or 3rd party fields, if the `shop_as_client_update_customer_data` filter is set to `true`;
* No warning about the lack of information on the “Order Received” / “Thank You” page on WooCommerce 7.8.1 and above;
* PRO add-on: The `shop_as_client_pro_customer_data` filter does not work;
* Report to us if you find more limitations, using the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/shop-as-client/);

= Can I contribute with a translation? =

Sure. Go to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/shop-as-client) and help us out.
